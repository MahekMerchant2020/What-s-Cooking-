# What's Cooking?

This Machine Learning Project aims to predict the cuisine of a dish based on the ingredients used to prepare it. 
The dataset used for training the classification models was provided by Yummly on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/c/whats-cooking/.
The classification models fit on the training dataset were used to predict the cuisines of the dishes in the test data.
The output files contain the cuisines predicted by each machine learning algorithm as well as the classification accuracy of each algorithm.

Thank you!
